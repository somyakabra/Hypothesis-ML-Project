# Hypothesis-ML-Project
We can predict how many medals a country will win at the Olympics by using historical data.
.

# Machine learning project steps
We'll use data from historical Olympic games. We'll try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data


# Making the data ready to Apply ML Model

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.

## Steps Followed
1. STEP 1: Loading the data
2. STEP 2: Data exploration
3. STEP 3: Building our model
4. STEP 4: Measuring error
