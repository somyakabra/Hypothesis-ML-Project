# Hypothesis-ML-Project
We can predict how many medals a country will win at the Olympics by using historical data.
.

# Machine learning project steps
We'll use data from historical Olympic games. We'll try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data


# Making the data ready to Apply ML Model

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.

## Steps Followed
1. STEP 1: Loading the data
2. STEP 2: Data exploration
3. STEP 3: Building our model
4. STEP 4: Measuring error

  ## Primary Problems Addressed:
1. Resource Allocation: Efficiently distributing financial and training resources across various sports and disciplines.
2. Performance Prediction: Accurately predicting medal counts helps in setting realistic targets and expectations.
3. Understanding Influencing Factors: Identifying key factors that contribute to winning medals (e.g., GDP, population size, investment in sports).
4. Data-Driven Decision Making: Encouraging sports authorities and policymakers to rely on data-driven strategies.
5. Benchmarking: Providing benchmarks for countries to compare their performance against similar nations.
6. Improving Competitive Edge: Helping countries to understand their competitive position and areas needing improvement.

   We hypothesize that we can predict the number of medals a country will win at the Olympics using historical data and various features such as past performance, economic indicators, population size, investment in sports, and other relevant factors.

## Impact of the Project:
0. Strategic Planning for Sports Authorities:
National sports authorities and committees can use predictions to allocate resources more efficiently.
Helps in identifying areas where a country is underperforming and needs improvement.
1. Policy Making:
Governments can formulate better policies for sports development.
Enhanced understanding of the relationship between investment in sports and performance.
2. Sponsorship and Investment:
Corporations and sponsors can identify high-potential countries and athletes for investment.
Better predictions help in making more informed decisions regarding sponsorship deals.
3. Athlete Training Programs:
Insights into which sports are likely to bring medals can help tailor athlete training programs.
Resources can be directed towards promising sports disciplines.
4. Sports Research and Development:
Facilitates academic and practical research in sports performance and analytics.
Contributes to the body of knowledge on factors influencing sports success.
